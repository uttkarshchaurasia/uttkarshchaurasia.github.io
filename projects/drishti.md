**Project description:** The project intends to solve a fundamental problem for visually impaired people, i.e., navigating through obstacles. As they don't have any visual input from their surroundings, they cannot take any non-intuitive decisions to avoid the challenges, which usually leads to accidents. So to solve this problem, a Computer-Aided navigation system that can analyse visual input is provided, take decisions and aid them in navigation by sending electrical impulses directly to the muscles using electrodes. Solving this problem is vital as visually impaired people struggle to navigate obstacles, especially in a new unknown environment. They generally use a cane (which is not effective) or depend on humanitarian assistance. As we are using visual analysis of obstacles, it can be done quite effectively using Computer-Vision, and its efficiency can be increased manifold using Machine Learning. This project uses quite simple electronic equipment like Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, Muscle stimulator, Muscle Stimulator electrodes etc. As the equipment is not very complex, it is easy to manufacture and repair the product, and due to this fact, only the product's price is relatively low and is compatible with a smartphone.

### Market Analysis

#### Customer need identification

1. The project mainly focuses on helping blind people become self-reliant and independent when navigating through busy roads, crowded streets, and challenging terrain. The Survey is taken by My Voice, which records the difficulties and expectations of the blind clearly shows their inability to use todayâ€™s technology for their help. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1235zr3qG1PiDtsmFYt6XBmP0tAwXl1tD) of the survey.

  They also feel that holding a cane while commuting makes them an easy target for hate crimes. The project is a revolutionising step in this direction.

2. Road accidents have had such a trend in the past years. If this is the case for pedestrians with normal eyesight, these statistics raise significant concern for the safety of the visually impaired on the streets. The project aims at reducing that threat. Here is the [link](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/road-users/ pedestrians/data-details/) for the trend.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
