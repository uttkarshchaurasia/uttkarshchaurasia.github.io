**Project description:** The project intends to solve a fundamental problem for visually impaired people, i.e., navigating through obstacles. As they don't have any visual input from their surroundings, they cannot take any non-intuitive decisions to avoid the challenges, which usually leads to accidents. So to solve this problem, a Computer-Aided navigation system that can analyse visual input is provided, take decisions and aid them in navigation by sending electrical impulses directly to the muscles using electrodes. Solving this problem is vital as visually impaired people struggle to navigate obstacles, especially in a new unknown environment. They generally use a cane (which is not effective) or depend on humanitarian assistance. As we are using visual analysis of obstacles, it can be done quite effectively using Computer-Vision, and its efficiency can be increased manifold using Machine Learning. This project uses quite simple electronic equipment like Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, Muscle stimulator, Muscle Stimulator electrodes etc. As the equipment is not very complex, it is easy to manufacture and repair the product, and due to this fact, only the product's price is relatively low and is compatible with a smartphone.

### Technical Analysis

#### Objective

The objective is to enable visually impaired people and non-attentive pedestrians to navigate through obstacles by a non-intuitive method of muscle stimulation of sartorial muscles. Smarter real-time decisions are made using Computer Vision Technique and ultrasonic sensors. Users can also navigate from one point to another using Google Navigation assistants.

#### Proposed solution

#### Innovativeness of proposed solution

The idea is undoubtedly innovative as it provides an interface between a computer's intelligence and the human nervous system (specifically motor neurones). We are aware that the idea of using electrical impulses to control muscles is not new. Still, here we are, providing a computer (Raspberry Pi in our case )as an alternative for the brain(of visually impaired people) to process visual data and take decisions accordingly. We are also providing intelligence (artificially) to the device, due to which it can learn and will be better at its job with every use.

#### Impact of the proposed solution

The solution can prove to be very helpful for visually impaired people. Navigating independently without any human assistance will surely boost their confidence, becoming more self-dependent. They can participate in more activities restricted by their impaired vision, gradually bringing them to the mainstream. The voltages we use for electrical impulses are less and physic-therapist verified, so it is harmless for the body. As the device is unsophisticated and easy to maintain, it can be a revolutionary product for visually impaired people, and in future, it will be as familiar as prosthetic limbs. This type of system can be later converted to portable wearable to walk carefree even when they are non-attentive and smartphone use. The data collected from the device can be sold to big data clients such as Google to enhance their maps by adding obstacle details.

### Market Analysis

#### Customer need identification

1. The project mainly focuses on helping blind people become self-reliant and independent when navigating through busy roads, crowded streets, and challenging terrain. The Survey is taken by My Voice, which records the difficulties and expectations of the blind clearly shows their inability to use todayâ€™s technology for their help. Here is the [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1235zr3qG1PiDtsmFYt6XBmP0tAwXl1tD) of the survey. They also feel that holding a cane while commuting makes them an easy target for hate crimes. The project is a revolutionising step in this direction.

2. Road accidents have had such a trend in the past years. If this is the case for pedestrians with normal eyesight, these statistics raise significant concern for the safety of the visually impaired on the streets. The project aims at reducing that threat. Here is the [link](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/road-users/ pedestrians/data-details/) for the trend.

3. Major navigating platforms out there also lack short paths that are either undetected by satellites or are seasonal paths that are only usable during some seasons. These routes may be the fastest and most suitable routes when navigating through some terrains, and still, major navigating platforms might not recommend them just because they do not have them in their database. These observations and recordings of our project can be sold to Big Data Clients.

#### Serviceable addressable markets (SAM)

1. Government medical hospitals : The project will lead to faster treatment of blind people. It provides a lifetime solution rather than keeping the patient chained to the tedious cycle of returning to the hospital now and then.

2. Big Data Clients : Those willing to improve and optimise their navigation platform can get a good collection of valuable data recorded by our products.

#### Product differentiation with respect to competitors

1. Accuracy more than GPS based products and [service providers](https://www.blindsquare.com/). Those who have tried to target the same issues have used GPS for navigation which does not provide real-time obstacle detection.

2. Our products do obstacle sensing using sensors as well rather than just simple image processing which increases accuracy. Hence, no faulty identification like this [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mediate.supersense) on play store.

#### Understanding of our customers and users

1. Customer : Government Hsopitals; User : Blind and visually impaired patients.

2. Customer and user : Big Data Clients

#### Distribution channel identification

1. Direct bulk supply to the hospital

2. Providing data of commonly used paths and those undetected by GPS and satellites.
